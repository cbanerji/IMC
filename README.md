# IMC
**Iterative Model Calibration (IMC) v1.0:** IMC is a generalizable framework for calibrating numerical models in geosciences, particularly geomorphology. It utilizes a Gaussian neighborhood algorithm to efficiently identify optimal parameters, enhancing model precision.

To run the IMC algorithm:
1) In a virtual environment install the dependencies (requirements.txt file).
2) Activate the environment
3) IMC_run.py is located at this PATH "CL1.9j_new\bin\Debug\IMC_run.py"  
   Go to the location and execute the file.  
   It supports command line argument.
